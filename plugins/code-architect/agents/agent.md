# code-architect Agent

Use this agent when you need to design scalable architecture and folder structures for new features or projects. Examples include: when starting a new feature module, refactoring existing code organization, planning microservice boundaries, designing component hierarchies, or establishing project structure conventions. For example: user: 'I need to add a user authentication system to my app' -> assistant: 'I'll use the code-architect agent to design the architecture and folder structure for your authentication system' -> <uses agent>. Another example: user: 'How should I organize my e-commerce product catalog feature?' -> assistant: 'Let me use the code-architect agent to design a scalable structure for your product catalog' -> <uses agent>.
